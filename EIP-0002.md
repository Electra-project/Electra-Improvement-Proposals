# [EIP-0002] Wallet Exchange Format

This RFC describes the Wallet Exchange Format, that is, the unique format used to exchange an Electra wallet with any application requiring a full access to this wallet.

## Conventions used in this document

### Hierarchical Deterministic Private Keys

The Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet **MUST** follow the [Bitcoin BIP32 proposal](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki).

The Hierarchical Deterministic Master Node private key **SHOULD** have been generated via a mnemonic saved by the final user (as described in [EIP-0001](https://github.com/Electra-project/Electra-Improvement-Proposals/issues/1)) in order to allow this final user to recover their wallet without a WEF file.

### Private Keys

The private keys **MUST** be encoded in _Base58_ (Bitcoin WIF format).

The private keys described in this document **SHOULD** be ciphered by a user passphrase, following the [BIP38](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0038.mediawiki) procedure.

### Format

The format **MUST** be a a valid JSON following [RFC 8259](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259) specifications, including the obligation of being encoded in UTF-8 ([RFC-3629](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3629)).

## Structure

The structure **MUST** be structured as above, following this exact order:

```txt
[
  VERSION_INTEGER,
  CHAINS_COUNT_INTEGER,
  HIERARCHICAL_DETERMINISTIC_MASTER_NODE_PRIVATE_KEY_STRING,
  RANDOM_ADDRESSES_PRIVATE_KEYS_STRING_ARRAY
]
```

## Content

### Version

    VERSION_INTEGER

The version integer **MUST** be equal to `2`.

Indeed, a first unofficial WEF exists in the form of a _[bitkeys](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4448.0)_ (commonly stored as a _wallet.dat_ file). The version `1` is then de facto reserved to the legacy  _bitkeys_ format.

### Chains Count

    CHAINS_COUNT_INTEGER

The chains count integer **MUST** be equal to the number of chains derived from the Hierarchical Deterministic first derived Account from the current wallet Master Node private key.

If the wallet is Hierarchical Deterministic, this value **MUST** be greater than `0`.

If the wallet is not (yet) Hierarchical Deterministic, the chains count **MUST** be equal to `0`.

### Hierarchical Deterministic Master Node Private Key

    HIERARCHICAL_DETERMINISTIC_MASTER_NODE_PRIVATE_KEY_STRING

The Hierarchical Deterministic Master Node private key string **MUST** be equal to its WIF private key.

If the wallet is not (yet) Hierarchical Deterministic, this private key **MUST** be equal to an empty string `""`.

### Random Addresses

    RANDOM_ADDRESSES_PRIVATE_KEYS_STRING_ARRAY

The random addresses private keys array **MUST** contain all the WIF private keys as strings.

If the wallet does NOT contain any random address, the array **MUST** be specified as an empty one `[]`.

> **Note**<br>
> This field exists to ensure the backward compatibility with the legacy C++ wallet which generated random addresses.<br>
> Any new wallet SHOULD not generate any new random address anymore in order to keep the WEF data as light as possible and ease the private keys ciphering and deciphering process.

## Examples

### New HD Wallet

```json
[
  2,
  1,
  "QzVmCEXn5nVeCdfm915MFSZc6kBQk2NaDBHaGFP7n9Dshq94bp64",
  []
]
```

### Hybrid Wallet (HD + Legacy)

```json
[
  2,
  5,
  "QzVmCEXn5nVeCdfm915MFSZc6kBQk2NaDBHaGFP7n9Dshq94bp64",
  [
    "QyrDwLLxdprp8XXfcRPSpikPpFh19zXLP6NBgwVfXbLd4nTz3Sza",
    "QwsxAmZ6ndFH5CeSswZ9ybTMx5qZfJU6KM62qpQTsgMtvofQnVFz"
  ]
]
```

### Legacy Wallet

```json
[
  2,
  0,
  "",
  [
    "QyrDwLLxdprp8XXfcRPSpikPpFh19zXLP6NBgwVfXbLd4nTz3Sza",
    "QwsxAmZ6ndFH5CeSswZ9ybTMx5qZfJU6KM62qpQTsgMtvofQnVFz"
  ]
]
```
