# Electra Improvement Proposals

## Why this repository ?

Because some of our choices can't be resolved by simply following BIPs, either because they may not be adapted to some of our cases, or because they don't answer one of our particular issue. The goal of these EIPs is not to write 20 pages RFCs as [BIPs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips) often are â€’ unless it's really necessary, but to keep a clean and inclusive process to tackle our common issues as the number of applications and language adaptations grow.

## How proposals should be processed ?

1. [Open a new issue on this repository](https://github.com/Electra-project/Electra-Improvement-Proposals/issues)
2. The issue title should be `[EIP-XXXX] [DRAFT]`

## What are the states ?

A proposal state can be one of:

- DRAFT = Somebody submitted a proposal, and we are discussing it.
- PROPOSED = We found a consensus, and need to write a clean specification.
- REJECTED = Either we didn't find a consensus, or this proposal didn't match the need of adding a new EIP.
- FINAL = We accepted the "cleaned" specification. This EIP has to be integrated in the concerned repositories.
