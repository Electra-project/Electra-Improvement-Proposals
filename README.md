# Electra Improvement Proposals

## Why this repository ?

Because some of our choices can't be resolved by simply following BIPs. Some matters are out of the current BIPs scope. Some others require extended specifications since BIPs can be quite "wide". The goal of these EIPs is not to write 20 pages RFCs as [BIPs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips) often are â€’ unless it's really necessary, but to keep a clean and inclusive process in order to tackle our common issues as the number of applications and languages grow.

Secondarily it also allows all contributing developers to discuss and share a common documentation on how certain matters should be handled.

## How proposals should be started ?

1. [Open a new issue on this repository](https://github.com/Electra-project/Electra-Improvement-Proposals/issues)
2. The issue title should be `[EIP-XXXX] [DRAFT]`
3. The issue content should be able to answer these 3 questions:
  - What does it concern ?
  - Why is this an issue ?
  - What solution do you propose ?

## What are the states ?

A proposal state can be one of:

- DRAFT = Somebody submitted a proposal, and we are discussing it.
- PROPOSED = We found a consensus, and need to write a clean specification.
- REJECTED = Either we didn't find a consensus, or this proposal didn't match the need of adding a new EIP.
- FINAL = We accepted the "cleaned" specification. This EIP has to be integrated in the concerned repositories.
